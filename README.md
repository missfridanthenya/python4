# 📂 File Read & Write Challenge

This Python program demonstrates **file handling** and **error management**.  
It reads the contents of a file, modifies the text, and writes the results into a new file.

## 🚀 Features
- Reads an existing file (entered by the user).
- Converts the content to **uppercase**.
- Saves the modified content in a new file named `modified_<filename>`.
- Handles errors gracefully (e.g., file not found, permission issues).

## ▶️ Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python file_read_write.py
